                  Bennie O. Pearce (BOP) is a musician/producer/songwriter, and
                  founder of Phillie-BOP Productions. The Philadelphia,
                  Pennsylvania native was immersed aurally in diverse music
                  styles from jazz to R&B to classics from an early childhood.
                  His musical foundation was heavily influenced by the music of
                  producers/songwriters/musicians such as Kenny Gamble and Leon
                  Huff, Thom Bell and Linda Creed, Smokey Robinson, Eddie
                  Holland-Lamont Dozier-Brian Holland, Stevie Wonder, The
                  Carpenters, Quincy Jones, Leon Sylvers, Teddy Riley, Babyface,
                  Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and Chuckii Booker, to name a few.
                  The bass guitar serves as his main tool of musical expression,
                  he is self-taught, and began playing professionally at the
                  tender age of 15.
                  <br /> <br />
                  His musical influences are expansive and span over a few
                  decades ranging from classic soul, big band music, jazz, R&B,
                  and jazz fusion. Bennieâ€™s arrangements are pure and powerful,
                  leaving a melody imprinted indelibly in the minds of
                  listeners. Bennie Pearce has a unique sound destined to create
                  a new level of quality in a music with no genre confines.
                  Bennie is a member of the American Society of Composers and
                  Publishers (ASCAP). He is an independent publisher under
                  Phillie-BOP Music.
