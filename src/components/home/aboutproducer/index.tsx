                    Bennie O. Pearce (BOP) is a musician/producer/songwriter,
                    and founder of Phillie-BOP Productions. The Philadelphia,
                    Pennsylvania native was immersed aurally in diverse music
                    styles from jazz to R&B to classics from an early childhood.
                    His musical foundation was heavily influenced by the music
                    of producers/songwriters/ musicians such as Kenny Gamble and
                    Leon Huff, Thom Bell and Linda Creed, Smokey Robinson, Eddie
                    Holland-Lamont Dozier-Brian Holland, Stevie Wonder, The
                    Carpenters, Quincy Jones, Leon Sylvers, Teddy Riley,
                    Babyface, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and Chuckii Booker, to
                    name a few. The bass guitar serves as his main tool of
                    musical expression, he is self-taught, and began playing
                    professionally at the tender age of 15. <br /> <br />
                    His musical influences are expansive and span over a few
                    decades ranging from classic soul, big band music, jazz,
                    R&B, and jazz fusion. Bennieâ€™s arrangements are pure and
                    powerful, leaving a melody imprinted indelibly in the minds
                    of listeners. Bennie Pearce has a unique sound destined to
                    create a new level of quality in a music with no genre
                    confines. Bennie is a member of the American Society of
                    Composers and Publishers (ASCAP). He is an independent
                    publisher under Phillie-BOP Music.
